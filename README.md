# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
To import and analyze the data to not only answer the questions that were asserted but to also understand consumer behavior across the Globe. 

## Process
### Primarily it was to import the data set. After going through CSV files, naming each columns were incredibly important. Especially when importing them, certain column names had quotation marks around it and so I had to clean the data to make it more efficient by re-naming the columns. 
Also removing the Null data, column sets where it had only one value, add new columns especially after JOINING to add average column sets. 
Secondary steps post cleaning the data sets were Joining the tables together, doing summations of Data sets to find which city/ country had the most impact. I suppose almost every question ensured Joining two table sets with exception of the first question.

## Results
The results were determined through a lot of Joining data sets together and filtering out columns that were unnecessary and required. Through this I was able to ascertain multiple point of views that can tackle the objectives. A lot of tables had similarities and thus provided different ways to understand consumerism. Psychology of visitors in each country were ascertained for instance, Google Nest was the greatest product purchased in USA while stationary items were bigger in European countries. 

## Challenges 
Some challenges that I faced were the naming of the columns as SQL is very precise. Secondly, understanding the definitions of each column. I felt as if we had a subjective assertion into the table set. Going forward I believe asking tons of questions will provide a viable solution. To ask supervisors and managers to be able to better provide context to ensure theres no true subjectivity in the results. 

## Future Goals
Some future Goals are to gain more proficiency with the tool set. I believe the PGADMIN 4 is a phenomenal tool to really help sort and filter the data sets. Secondly, to push deeper and provide a greater contextualization of the data sets to better provide understanding.
